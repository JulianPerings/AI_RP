# AI RPG Frontend

React-based frontend for the AI Game Master RPG.

## Views

### 1. Player List (`/`)
- Displays all existing player characters
- Shows stats: level, health, gold, XP
- Click any player to go to their chat session
- Link to create new character

### 2. Create Character (`/create`)
- Form to create new player character
- Fields: name, class, race, starting location, backstory
- Backstory tip: mention items and NPCs for auto-setup
- Auto-creates first session on submission
- Redirects to chat with `?new=true` to trigger intro

### 3. Chat (`/chat/:playerId`)
- Real-time chat with the AI Game Master
- Shows tool calls made by the LLM
- **Loading indicator** while GM responds:
  - Input disabled during response
  - Animated quill + rotating flavor text
  - Prevents sending multiple messages
- Auto-scrolls to latest message
